# euler-tour
## This is a Project created as an assignment for the Algorithm Engineering course of the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department of the University of Patras

Developer:
Alexandros Panagiotis Soilemezidis (Alexsoil)

### Description

Implementation (using any library - STL, BOOST, LEDA) of dynamic Euler-Tour trees and their functionality as described on [HK95, Section 2.2], and thorough experimental testing using random and synthetic data in comparison to LEDA dynamic trees.
Bonus: Visualization of tree functionality.
